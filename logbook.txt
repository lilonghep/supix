20200706
* RunInfo	- print CDS noise
* waveform	- SupixAnly, added to control plots
  
20200707
* seperate stats() out of Timer.
* daq.cxx	- usage() improved

* improved noise treatment
  - noise_run mode added: daq.exe -N ...
  - noise_run SHOULD be taken before a physics run.
  - noise files are saved in the same directory as data files.
  - noise files with normalized names are hard linked to the newest
    noise files simultaneously for reading.
  - in physics run, noise data are saved in RunInfo.
  - RunInfo is updated to version 3 accordingly.
  - SupixTree is updated as well.
  - pipeline_t is updated with O_NOISE mode.
  - SupixAnly and analyser.C are updated as well.


20200708 - wm
* record in root fired pixels for data analysis.
  - npixs, pixid[npixs]


20200709 - wm
* ADC noise added.
  RunInfo v4		- adc_mean/sigma added


20200710
* SupixDAQ		- cds trigger changed for negative pulses

* waveform analysis
  SupixDAQ		- npixs and pixid[] added to tree
  			- frame_1st removed from tree
  SupixAnly		- waveforms for individual pixels
  			- baseline corrected CDS & ADC
* analyser
  - g_print added to control c1->Print(...)
  - baseline() added to visualize CDS & ADC noise parameters in
    RunInfo.
  - more plots added.

* SupixAnly
  - TH1D trig_cds added.
  - waveform code seperated from main Loop().

* pipeline_t
  - [bugfix] lock all actions, otherwise ntrigs_cds not consistent.


20200711
* improved control plots.
  - analyser: automate drawing and saving.
  - SuperAnly: re-arranged/-define some histograms.
  - Timer: added printing in different units.

20200712
* analysis
  - column marks added.
  - print-control utilities moved to common_root.h
  - scan() moved to SupixAnly
  
* book.cxx added to seperate histogram booking from analysis.
  - RunInfo added.
  
* SupixAnly
  - sum_cds vs npixs added.

20200713
* data taking
  - DAQ_MODE_t defined.
  - CONTINUOUS mode added for waveform analysis.
  - RunInfo version updated to 5.

* analysis
  - selected pixel for waveform.
  - waveform of sum ADC and CDS per frame added.


20200714
* analysis
  - normalize CDS and ADC with noise sigma
  - analyser::waveform_pix() added set_print().

* common_root.h
  - watermark() added.

* event display added.
  - with event information


20200715
* CDS trigger threshold (trig_cds) changed from int to double.
  - RunInfo V6

* more waveforms of sum CDS added.

* chi2_cds added for Esum study.


20200717
* common_root.h
  - set_pave() added.
  - set_stats() improved
  - divide() added to replace TPad::Divide()

* analyser
  - added functions drawing pixels' ADC and CDS.


20200719
* all pixels' ADC and CDS waveformed added.
* Nup_CL.cxx added to estimate pipeline length.
* some clean-up

* analysis: dTevt added on control plots.

* waveforms of pixels are saved in a subdir instead of TList because
  of bytecount limit.


20200725
* fixed empty RunInfo issue of ROOT v5
* information improved.



TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------
analysis
* what to check?
* visualize noise distribution
* CDS distribution of fired pixels
* physics signal: number of hits or sum of amplitudes?
  - dependence on trigger threshold?
  - cluster?

* control plots
  - all triged: trig
  - cds triged: fid, npixs, cds, adc (raw, cor, all, frame)
  
  - random trig
  - hit pattern, cluster
  - duration between two consecutive trigs

DAQ
* how to assign #frame via reader?
* Esum?
* continuous data taking


Makefile

会：FIFO数据格式和buffer等

issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error in <TBufferFile::WriteByteCount>: bytecount too large (more than 1073741822)

TList = 1024 TMultiGraph x 1024 frames x 64 waves
